== Jobs

In the beginning when God made Adam, He gave him the job to "be
fruitful over the earth, multiply, and subdue it." (Genesis 1:28) Later
when He placed Adam in the garden, God gave him the specific task of
cultivating the earth (Genesis 2:5) and of naming all the animals on the
earth - thus expressing leadership over them. (Genesis 2:19) Before the
fall of man, God created two perfectly good types of work - menial labor
(cultivating the ground, subduing the earth) and creative labor (naming
the animals - using his intellectual faculties). Part of God's original
plan for mankind was that man would have meaningful work to do - it was
only after the fall of Man and his rebellion against God that work
became hard and tedious. (Genesis 3:17-19) Before the fall, all of Man's
needs were met freely by the earth that God had created, but afterwards
Man had to do work to meet his own needs. Like it or not - this is now
the world we live in: we are required to work in order to meet
our own needs like food and shelter. While you may have wished to be
independently wealthy so you don't have to work, attempting to dodge
this curse actually brings about worse problems: we become lazy,
entitled, and ungrateful.

Because Christianity is a religion rooted in the reality that God has
created, the bible has plenty to say about work and its role in our
lives. How could a faith that came from God not have something to say
about the 1/3 of our lives we'll spend working? In this chapter, we'll
first cover some crucial attitudes about work that will ensure your
success in the job market, then cover some specific topics about finding
and keeping employment in the perspective of your overall service to
God.

=== Attitudes Toward Work

==== Work is a Necessity

Proverbs 21:25-26 is clear about the fate of those who refuse to work:
Their own desire puts them to death! However, the righteous give and do
not hold back, because they have worked and have something to share.
This principle is strongly echoed in the New Testament letter to the
Thessalonians, who quit their jobs when they heard the Gospel: Paul
teaches them that if someone will not work then they should not be allowed to
eat! (2 Thessalonians 3:10) At the risk of being labeled a sexist - I
will say that this seems to be much more relevant to men than women.
I've known many godly women whose parents have paid for school, room,
and board, but have still grown spiritually and led others into
spiritual maturity. However, I have known very few men who did not hold
at least a part-time job and were still effective spiritually. I believe
this is because since God declares that men are to have a servant
leadership role in their households, they should bring home the lion's
share of the bread, while still helping out around the house and raising
children. This isn't the 1950's ideal of men working all day and then
having women keep house - the man is to serve in every area, just as
Christ served us by dying on the Cross for us. Men who will one day have
a family should learn to work hard at students, so they can work hard in
the workplace. The worst quarter of my life spiritually was when I was
in college and my parents paid all my bills. My savings account
depleted, and I was completely ineffective spiritually.

While it's possible to live on your parent's dole while you're a
student, regardless of your gender working a job has more benefits than
just spending money. You're developing a good work ethic, storing up
money to serve with and give to God's work, and meeting people in the
world with whom you can share God's love. If your parents are generous
enough to provide for your schooling and other expenses, you might still
consider picking up a 10-20 hour/week part time job to gain these extra
benefits.

==== Work is Good

We saw in the introduction to this chapter that God created mankind to
have work, not just to sit around in the garden doing nothing. Be it
unskilled or menial labor, or knowledge-working and creative labor, God
created us to apply our gifts and work. There's a satisfaction in doing
your job that you can't get by levelling up in World of Warcraft or
sitting at home watching TV.

This principle is echoed in the New Testament in Colossians 3. v17
directs us that "Whatever you do in word or deed - do all in the name of
the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father" Later in
verse 23, he directs servants to do their work as if they were working
for God himself. Some commentators take these verses to mean that your
work is a calling, that some people do in place of serving God full time
as ministers. However, this contradicts Peter's teaching in 1 Peter 2:9
- that we are now "a nation of priests, a holy priesthood for God's own
possession." It isn't so much that you're either a priest (or pastor
or clergy) or a lay-person (someone who works vocationally in the
marketplace), but that you are a priest who also works in the
marketplace, unless you're serving God to such an extent that the church
decides to bring you on staff so you can serve God full-time. Under the
new covenant, we can bring God's message of redemption outside the
church and into our work, since we are fundamentally priests - people
who speak about God and introduce people to God. God is behind our
efforts to work for our daily bread and to minister to the needs of
others just as much as he is behind our work of trying to introduce
people to Jesus.

==== We Should Work Hard

In the same passage, servants are called to do serve not only with
external service, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the lord
(Colossians 3:22) And, "Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for
the Lord, not for men. (v23)" We shouldn't be people who under-work and
do the bare minimum that is necessary to get by, but instead when we are
at work we should be some of the hardest workers at our job. Not only is
this commanded by God, it also makes us a good witness to our bosses,
and ensures that we will be able to do well financially. Under-work is
typically a blue-collar, manual labor problem where it's easier to
succumb to laziness, but with modern technology it can also be a problem
in white-collar jobs where people are at a computer all day, and can
surf the internet instead of working hard for their paycheck.

==== We Should Keep Work in it's Place

Continuing in Colossians 3, Paul says that we work "Knowing that from
the Lord we will receive a reward, for it is the Lord Christ who you
serve. (v24)" We have to remember that we were given innumerable riches
when we met Christ - they're stored up safely in heaven for us where
thieves cannot break in and moths cannot destroy. Likewise, Christ is
our true boss, and He is the one who directs our service. Just as we
have to be wary of under-working, we also have to be wary of
over-working. Since Christ is our true boss, it's inappropriate for us
to give our entire lives over to working for the world's system. We
should work a reasonable amount of hours to provide for our needs and
giving, and then give the rest of our time to relationships and serving
God in other ways. Over-work is typically more common in career jobs,
but the modern management style is to attempt to squeeze as much as
possible from employees in order to maximize profits. We have to draw
clear boundaries with our jobs, in order to avoid falling into the trap
of spending all of our time at the office. See the section on
negotiating with bosses later on in this chapter for how to make this
case to your boss.
