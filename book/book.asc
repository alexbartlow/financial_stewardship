== Financial Tools
=== Cash
=== Credit Card
=== Debit Card
If you're going to carry a debit card, it would be a good idea to set up
some rules for yourself on when you're going to allow yourself to use
it. In general, only use your debit card on expenses that you've planned
for, like gas and food at the grocery store. You can pay for everything
else with cash. Keeping your disposable income in cash means you won't
track it online with Mint, but you will be able to see how much you have
left to spend each week by just looking at your wallet. Consider taking
out an allowance in cash at the ATM (The ATM for your bank - don't throw
money away by using another bank's ATM. You'll get hit with fees by both
the bank you used, and your own bank for a 'foreign withdrawal charge'.
This can be as much as $5/withdrawal, so if you take out money 4 times a
month you're throwing away $20/month for no reason!).
