== First Things First

When you're starting off on your journey to wise financial stewardship,
you have to make sure that you're putting first things first. It does
you no good to spend a bunch of time, energy, and money advancing in the
wrong direction. This chapter is a brief overview of what your money
will primarily be going toward as a wise financial steward, and why you
should look at your priorities in this order.

=== Giving

Lots of financial literature will tell you that you should be 'paying
yourself first.' This means that you should be putting your money to
work for you first through investments that will pay off in the long
run, instead of giving it away to expenses. As stewards, we believe that
we need to be offering God the first-fruits of our efforts. This
principle is reflected in the Old Testament law, that says when you
plant a field, you should take the first fruits of the harvest and give
them to God's work.

You may feel like giving off-the-top like this is robbing you of your
hard-earned money, but actually, your money was never yours to begin
with! Everything you have has been given to you - your time, physical
ability to work, and even your socio-economic status in this rich
culture of America was all given to you, and God expects a return on
that investment.

Giving to the Lord's work is the surest way to ensure that you don't
fall pray to materialism later on in life. By developing a habit of
giving early and being generous, you're training yourself to stay away
from impulse-buys and an over-focus on your spending. By offering up the
first-fruits of your labors to God, you're also making an impact in
eternity. God is doing powerful work through the Church, and by
supporting the effort of the church, you're supporting the spread of the
Gospel and people coming to know God.

Several years ago, our church was raising money for a new building on
campus to help support our growing student ministry. I decided to pledge
to help buy that building, and even though my contribution was small,
God says that he loves a joyful giver, and that small gifts given out of
your own need are worth far more in his eyes than large gifts given out
of abundance. When we got our new building, it was a mess, and needed
some demolition work done. Not only was it fun tear down walls, but it
also was deeply satisfying to know that I had a part in purchasing the
building in the first place.

God will reward you in heaven for everything you've done on Earth. That
includes your financial giving! There's no easier way to get behind the
work that God is doing than to write a check - all it takes is a couple
seconds to write the check, and a couple hours a month at work to
fulfill your pledge. That's it! Think of all the work you've done for
God, and how much prayer, thinking, and study had to go into even the
smallest accomplishments for God's kingdom. That's a much bigger time
investment than $20 a month! If we're willing to do the big things that
God requires of us, it makes no sense to reject doing the small things
that God has called you to, and financial giving is a part of that.
It doesn't matter if you start off with small pledge, less than $20 a
week will do. The point is that you want to start training yourself as
soon as possible to be faithful with your money.

If you haven't made a pledge to your church, do it now! Pick up the
phone, go online, or talk to someone else in your church to figure out
how to give, and do it. Put down the book and take care of this! Without
a proper view of your money backed up by a pledge to support God's work,
you're fooling yourself if you think that you can break your other
habits of over-spending and indulgent spending.

=== Rent

This one seems like a no-brainer. Everyone needs to live somewhere, and
if you're not living with your parents, you're going to be paying rent.
You usually pay rent every month. It's a stable and predictable cost of
living.
Yet, many students come to the end of the month and find that they can't
pay rent, or are going to be late on rent until the next pay-check.

The fact that you have to pay roughly the same amount of rent every
month means that you can plan for it. We'll talk about how to set up a
budget in your next chapter, but for now, I want you to start thinking
about how rent is something that happens on a regular basis, it's
unavoidable, and you'd do well to get it out of the way as quick as
possible.

=== Food

US Consumers spend $1 Trillion dollars each year on food. We all know we
need to eat. Because this is such a basic need, it's no surprise that
restaurants make a ton of money selling food to a hungry (and
over-weight) American public.

Like Rent, food is something that you're going to have to pay for
whether you like it or not. 1 Thessalonians says if someone will not
work, he should not be allowed to eat either! So what's to consider?

Eating fast-food is one of the surest ways to take money straight from
your bank account, turn it into fat, and attach it to your sides. Fast
food is unhealthy and expensive. And yet, it's so easy, many students
don't even think twice about eating as many as 10 meals a week at fast
food restaurants. The high fat and sugar content of fast food is
addictive as well - McDonald's gets 70% from 'super-heavy-users', just
25% of their customers who are so addicted by the taste of a Big Mac
that they'll go to the golden arches three or four times a week. [Super
Size Me] Of course, man cannot live on McDonald's alone, so people
eating there that much probably eat a bunch of other fast food as well. 

You're going to need a certain amount of calories each day to move
around and go about your life. We'll talk in the food chapter about ways
to get those calories in the cheapest, most nutritious way possible.

=== Gas

Gas is one of the first things here that you might be able to skimp on.
If you ride a bike to work and school, you will probably save yourself a
lot of money and expense right here. However, because the public
transport system where I live is pretty bad, having a car is a fact of
life. If you have a car, you should plan on a regular gas budget so
you're not continually surprised at the pump.

=== Meet Pressing Needs

You may find it peculiar that I've placed this here, above savings and
purchases. Haven't I already given my money away already? Why do I need
to do it again?

Scripture identifies two categories for financial gifts. The first are
tithes are regularly scheduled giving, that you're going to budget for
no matter what. The second is meeting pressing needs, helping out people
in your church or community that need a little extra help. Not only is
this commanded of us and helpful for your community, it's also a great
witness. All the way back to the dawn of the church, Christians were
selling their possessions and giving to those who are in need. By making
sure that you're putting aside a little extra each month for those extra
needs, yours or others, you're taking part in having the Church known as
a group that cares about people, and advancing the spread of the Gospel.

Imagine the shock when a new believer is lamenting the cost of books for
the quarter at Home Church, and afterwards someone comes up and offers
to go book shopping with them, and covers the cost of their most
expensive textbook. What a testimony to the truth of the Gospel - God
gave himself for others, and now we give freely to other people. Can you
imaging all the cynical attitudes and doubts that just disappeared with
that single act of kindness?

One of the goals of being a wise steward is not just that your own
accounts are in order, but that you are free to help others in their
time of need. By budgeting for this and having a category in your mind
for helping others, you're establishing a crucial part of your financial
wellness.

=== Savings

Again, this one might surprise you. I'm a college student, what do I
have left over to save? The idea of having a surplus of money at the end
of the months might seem a foreign idea to you now, but if you apply
what we talk about later on in this book about budgeting, working a
gainful job, reducing your materialistic purchases, and being sensible
about your monthly expenses, you probably will have money left over to
save.

Having a couple months of expenses in the bank is a great thing. It
means you can still make rent when you're between jobs, that you don't
have to work extra hours to pay for a retreat, and that you're able to
give freely to others when pressing needs come up. Start developing a
vision in your mind of what your life could look like if you save
diligently, of not having to worry what happens if your car breaks down
or you lose your job. It's easy to go overboard with this, since money
can never buy you real security (You need Christ for that), but it can
buy you time in the future when things get rough. Following the tips in
the budgeting chapter will help you save money, little by little each
month, until you have a surplus that you can tap into when you need it.

=== Purchases and Materialism

Purchases like this are the last thing you'll want to consider, after
all your savings and everything else has been paid for. Ideally, your
bigger purchases, more than 10% of your monthly income, will all be
things that you've thought about and planned for more than a month in
advance. If instead you're spending money on impulse buys like this each
month, you'll have no money left for saving, meeting pressing needs, or
the big expenses like car repairs when the time comes. What's worse,
you'll be training yourself into a pattern of spending that will destroy
you when you get into a career - you'll find that you're quickly
surrounded by things you don't need, but still as stressed as ever about
how you're just barely scraping by.

Have you ever wondered how someone can make $100,000 a year and still
think they're barely scraping by each month? One big reason is that
people in these situations have made financial commitments that are too
big, like buying too much house or too expensive of a car, and the
monthly loan payments add up quickly. Just as common though is this
attitude of impulse spending - when they cash their $4,000 paycheck
every two weeks, their first thought is electronics, games, and other
frivolous purchases.

Train yourself now to avoid this disastrous habit in the future. If
you're going to make a purchase more than 10% of your monthly income,
think about it for a month before you buy it. One of my rules that helps
me a lot when thinking about a big purchase is reading Ecclesiastes
through once for every $1,000 I'm planning on spending. This reminds me
that me money and everything on this earth is a temporary thing, and I'm
really throwing away eternal rewards by blowing cash on stupid stuff.
You might want to pick up the same pattern, but adjust the dollar amount
for your situation - maybe read through it once for every $100 or $200
you're going to spend. Before buying a new computer, guitar, or
skateboard, you should consider where else that money could be put to
use.

Another trap is always thinking that you have to have the best products.
Maybe you need a laptop for school (Being able to write a paper anywhere
I wanted helped my productivity quite a bit!). Instead of spending
$1,000 on a new MacBook Air, spend $250 on a refurbished Thinkpad
instead. It'll be a couple years older and not as fast, but it's solid
as a rock and will do everything you need it to do. Let's be honest,
most of what you want a laptop for is going to be to write papers, get
online, and check Facebook anyway. Maybe you're considering a
smart-phone purchase. Think really hard if there's anything that
smart-phone will do that will improve your quality of life over a
dumb-phone that makes phone calls and sends text messages just as well.
Sure, apps and games are fun, but are they really worth the added
expense of a $20/month data plan? You'd probably get more mileage from
buying $20/month in books from Half-Price Books, or another secondhand
book store. Not only will you be smarter and better-read, you can lend
those books to other people after you're done with them!

Even if you can afford these purchases, just because you can afford
something doesn't mean you should go ahead and buy it. As I look at my
bank account, there's a lot of things I could afford, but if I think
really hard, not a whole lot of things I could buy that would really
improve my life in any substantial way. Be stingy with these purchases,
and make sure that you're getting the best deal.

Another thing to consider is making purchases that have a higher
up-front cost, but save you money in the long run. I spent $30 a while
back on an old-school single-blade safety razor. It was a lot more expensive than a
cheap Mach 3 razor, but each blade costs $0.10 instead of $2.00, and my
face is a lot more smooth (which I think my girlfriend appreciates!)
Similarly, a friend of mine used to carry all of his textbooks to class
every day, so he would wear out his back-pack every year, and spend
$40/year on a new one. If he shelled out $80 early on for a good one,
he'd have saved himself some cash, and probably have been more
comfortable in the process.

Developing an cheap and stingy attitude towards big purchases is one of
the best things you can do for your spiritual health. By not buying big
ticket items whenever you want, you're going to be training yourself to
have self-control while also saving quite a bit of money in the process.
You're also not going to get ship-wrecked by materialistic lust later on
in life when you have all the disposable income you could ask for, but
still find yourself throwing it away every month buying more stuff.


=== Conclusion

Getting your priorities in order will help you make sound financial
decisions in the long run. To view your money as first going towards
giving, then rent, food and gas, followed by savings and meeting
pressing needs, and only last as a tool for purchases for yourself,
you're going to meet your budget. More importantly, you'll train yourself
in a godly perspective on money. It'll stop being a thing you covet and
can never get enough of, and start being something that fits into your
life, instead of ruling your life.
