== Long Term Planning

Hopefully, you're not going to be a student forever. At some point,
you're going to start your career and get a 'big boy/big girl' job. If
you neglect to plan for how you're going to live when you get there,
you're going to be shocked by having more money than you've ever handled
before, and you're probably going to make many foolish financial choices
that will hurt you spiritually.

He who is faithful with little will be faithful with much, so the
attitudes that you've been developing as a student will serve you well
as you move into your career. You don't want to obsess about 'making it
big' - that's just buying into materialism, but you do want to be
prepared to be faithful when the time comes. This chapter will discuss
some of the changes that occur when you're making a full-time career
paycheck.

=== Jobs vs Career

One of the first changes in your mindset is going to be in regards to
where you work. While your first job out of school may be a full-time
gig that's not in your career field, and that's fine for a while, you'll
want to find something that sets up your career for growth. If you're
not working in your field, or something that you think might become your
field, you need to start planning an exit strategy from your first
full-time job. So you can get into a career as soon as possible.

Working a career job is both a job and an investment. Ideally, you'll be
making good money while also picking up the skills you need to advance
in due time. The best way to do this is to developed a 'T-Shaped' skills
profile. That means that you have both a wide general knowledge about
your field, but you also specialize in a certain aspect of it. As a
software developer, I specialize in Web Application Development, but I
also have a wide generalization in Database Optimization, System
Administration, Front-end design work, and a number of other skills that
are necessary to growing as a Developer.

Having this sort of 'T-Shaped' profile will allow you to pick and choose
your next job more effectively. You can either choose a job that gives
you a broad basis to expand your general skills, or you can choose a job
that gives you time to zero-in on what's going to be your core skill
set. Having a wide knowledge of a number of different subjects is going
to set you up to be a senior member of whatever team you'll be on, while
having a deep specialization is going to make you very valuable at
getting things done that are within your core competency. 

The rule of thumb for career jobs is to always take a job that's going
to set you up for your _next_ job. You get an entry level position to be
qualified to get a junior position, you move into a junior position to
learn the skills you need to be a senior in your field, and you become a
senior to learn the wide breadth of knowledge you'll need to manage or
lead in your field. This is different for every profession, so you'll
want to find a 'mentor' in your field who can help you figure out what
you want your career to look like. If this person is a mature Christian,
all the better. Many senior employees in most fields got there not
through careful planning, but through bone-breaking work where they
sacrificed the rest of their lives for their career. You'll want to
choose a mentor that got to where they were through careful strategic
planning, not through someone who sacrificed their family on the altar
of career. Because of this, you'll want to ask questions of prospective
mentors like "How do you manage work/life balance?" This is a safe
question because work/life balance is topic that many in the corporate
world talk about, but answers to this question can be telling. Do you
get the sense that your prospective mentor is happy with their family,
or are they trying to make as much money as possible in hopes that it
fixes their failing personal life?

This also looks different depending on the size of the company you're
working for. I've worked for both large government agencies and
corporations, as well as start-ups and small businesses. In smaller
businesses, you'll find that you can advance your skill-set much more
rapidly, since each employee has to cover a number of different bases,
where if you're in a large corporation the career path is typically much
more defined, and you may even find that if you want to generalize,
you're not given the opportunity to do so. Make sure your questions
during the interview (Since you're interviewing them as much as they're
interviewing you!) reveal what kind of company it is you'll be working
for, and that the work you'll be doing will prepare you for later job
positions in your career field.

=== Dealing with Plenty

You're in for quite a shock when you open your first pay-check in a
full-time career job. In addition to working full-time instead of
part-time, you'll probably be getting paid a lot more per hour as well.
Even knowing how much you're going to be making after accepting the
offer won't seem real until you see the amount they're actually paying
you to do your job printed on your paycheck.

Plan on just banking your paycheck for the first month or so, not making
any big purchases and sticking to your budget until the paycheck-shock
wears off. This will give you the opportunity to plan on re-adjusting
your budget and your giving without running out and getting into debt.
After your first budget adjustment, consider increasing your disposable
income slowly, if it all. If you're spending money just because you have
it now, you're being a terrible steward. Chances are that extra income
isn't going to affect your happiness all that much anyway. Instead, put
most of your new paycheck toward giving and savings. You can always
spend money you've saved, but it's hard to take-back foolish purchases
and bad spending. You'll also have to take into account grown-up
expenses, like your cell phone bill, car insurance, and student loan
payments. By waiting a while until you have all the facts, you can make
informed decisions about your budget.

=== Big Purchases

The advice given in the chapter on budgeting still stands for big
purchases - you should be saving up for anything that costs more than
10% of your gross income. This will help you avoid the trap of spending
money just because you have it, and keep you from going into consumer
debt. Likewise, still be wary of credit cards, even though you think you
might be able to pay them off better now that you have a full income. If
anything, they're even more dangerous now - since credit card companies
will see your new income and give you an increased credit limit
accordingly. Don't finance anything you could just save for with a
couple months of reduced spending. Any habits you develop now are going
to be really hard to break, and if you tell yourself that you're going
to save up after-the-fact by reducing your income, you're really kidding
yourself. Chances are there's going to be something else next month that you
wanted just as much as you did this month, and before you know it you're
in debt to yourself paying off all those old purchases.

Money can't buy happiness. Save up for expensive or luxury purchases.

=== Investments and Savings

The advice given earlier about having two months of your budget in your
checking account and six months of your budget in your savings account
still applies, but now you're going to want to save a total of eight
months of your _income_ as opposed to your _budget_. By smoothing out
your spending making that extra savings, you're going to be more
prepared for shocks to your pocket book along the way.

Once you've saved up that much, it's good to start thinking about
investments that can start putting your money to work for you. Investing
in the stock market through mutual funds and CDs are viable ways of
getting a return on your money. Mutual funds are a way of investing in
the stock market without taking on the risk of buying a particular
stock. When you invest in a mutual fund, the fund buys stock on your
behalf, so instead of having ten shares from one company you'll
automatically have one share from ten different companies. If the stock
to one company falls, you still have other stocks that are doing well.

There's a lot of different advice out there for investing in the stock
market, but my advice is that it's better to start a regular investment
plan in a mutual fund instead of buying a selling individual shares.
When you buy or sell stock, you have to pay a commission on the trade,
between $7 and $20 dollars per transaction depending on your brokerage -
a company that helps you buy or sell stock. That's fine for people who
are day-trading, gambling with thousands of dollars at a time to try and
make money off of the smaller fluctuations in the market, but it's bad
for a regular investment strategy since you'll be giving a chunk of your
savings to the brokerage every time you make an investment.

Mutual funds are in it for the long-run, and so they don't charge per
transaction, but they do make their money from you with an 'expense
ratio.' This is the amount of money that the fund takes out to pay its
manager's salaries. When searching for mutual funds, compare expense
ratios and find the lowest one.

In general, as long as you're not becoming a full-time stock trader,
it's pretty impossible for you to beat the market in the long term. The
best solution then is just to invest in the market as a whole through
the use of an 'Index Fund.' Index Funds invest their holdings across the
entire stock market, or a certain section of the market. This way,
you'll get a return consistent with the market as a whole, which is
generally constant. If the market tanks you'll lose money like everyone
did in 2008 with the banking crisis, but you'll also make money off the
rebound.

Many employers will offer to match funds that you put into a 401k - a
special account that is tax-designated to save for retirement (Yes, you
have to pay taxes on income from the stock market). This is
free money, and you should definitely match as much as you can into
retirement accounts. You also might have a shorter-term investment
account that's taxed, but you can also withdraw the money at any time
without penalty - for example to put the down payment on your first
house.

There's typically a $3000 minimum for investing in mutual funds, which
is why you might have to save up to start investing. However, once you
get over this initial speed-bump, you can set up a regular investment
plan through your bank or brokerage to invest a certain amount every
month, just like you do with your giving. This kind of regular,
consistent investment is the best way to build wealth over the
long-term, and it's a healthy financial habit to get into. By saving as
much as you can, you'll have a war-chest for when you need to make a big
purchase like a house, or going back to school for an advanced degree.

=== Paying off Debt vs. Investments

You'll probably have some amount of debt coming out of school, and so
it's important to understand the best place to put your money to
maximize your investments for the long term: either paying off debt or
making investments. The easiest way to do this is just to compare the
interest rates on your loans to the expected returns on your
investments. If the mutual fund into which you're investing gives you a
8.5% return, it's a smart move to invest more there instead of paying
off your student loans at, for example, 5%. However, if you have credit
card debt at 15% interest, pay that off before you make further
investments in the mutual fund.

Paying off debt also increases the amount available to you every month,
which can allow you to save for other purchases down the line. If you
have a regular car payment, paying a little extra each month will get it
paid off sooner, which means you'll save on interest payments, and after
it's paid off you'll have extra each month to put towards giving or
savings. By reducing the amount of money each month that goes towards
servicing your debts, you can put that monthly surplus into giving to
the church, which is really just an investment in your eternal
retirement fund.

=== Simple Living

If the normal night in for you is enjoyable conversation with your
roommates or wife, going out to a fancy restaurant for dinner becomes a
special occasion that can be enjoyed, not a normal part of your routine
that you take for granted. If you cut coupons and look for deals on
vacation spots, that vacation is going to be a lot more special and
enjoyable to you than one you've been waiting for to finally get some
good family time, because you've been so tied up at work you haven't
invested in your family. By spreading out these special occasions and
making the truly special, you're learning how to live contentedly and
happily with the life God has given you, not the gold-plated lie that
the world's system is trying to sell you.

The biggest adjustment to make when living with a full-income is the
adjustment from thinking "how much can I afford to spend" to "how much
should I spend." When you start thinking in terms of how much money you
need to spend, you're exercising simple living. By living simply and
making your life more about your relationships than your income, you're
freeing your mind from the burden of thinking about finances all the
time. You're also freeing your money to be put to use where it can
advance the gospel. If your happiness doesn't come from how much money
you're making, but from how vibrant your relationships (And your
relationship with God!) are, you're going to start experiencing what
Paul talked about when he said that "Godliness is a means of great gain
when it is accompanied by contentment." [1 Timothy 6:6]
