== Meeting Pressing Needs

Giving is in the DNA of the church. While both in the Old Covenant and
the New Covenant there are guidelines about how to structure giving in a
regular and predictable way (The Levitical Priesthood was supported by
the offerings given at appointed times, and in the NT the disciples were
laying their gifts at the feet of the Apostles [Acts 4:35]), the point
of giving isn't just to run the Church. Our giving should also be done
in order to meet pressing needs of the people around us. Pagan Roman
Emperors in the time of the first Christians were astonished to find
that there were no beggars or poor among the believers. [CITATION

2 Corinthians 8 shows an example of the Church meeting these pressing
needs - a collection was being taken up by churches in modern-day Turkey
for the church at Jerusalem, who was under persecution and also
suffering from drought. Titus 3:14 says that our meeting pressing needs is
key to us remaining fruitful. Galatians 6:2 says that carrying each
other's burdens fulfills the law of Christ. Ephesians 4:28 indicates
that our work should be done in order to provide for other believers.
Galatians 6:10 says that Christians should take priority in our giving.
Proverbs 14:31 promises that the Lord is honored by our gracious gifts
to the needy.

This chapter presupposes that you have made financial giving to your
local church a regular and consistent part of your budget. Galatians 6:6
indicates that we who are taught should share all good things with our
teachers, and 1 Timothy 5:17,18 is clear that those who work for the
church are worthy of their wages. 1 Corinthians 9:11-12 indicates that
gospel workers have the right to financial support from their church.
Without a vibrant local Church, there's no relational context for
meaningful ad-hoc giving to take place. If you're not supporting your
local church, scripture indicates that giving to your local church takes
precedence over anything discussed in this chapter.

=== Principles of Giving to Pressing Needs

==== Give to Burdens, not to Laden

Galatians 6:2 says that we must carry each other's burdens, but
Galatians 6:5 says that each person must carry their own laden. Laden
means the cargo that a ship must take on for the voyage - food, clean
water, extra supplies, etc. The principle then is that we should give to
needs that are unexpected and hard to carry, not those that are expected
and regular to function as a normal member of society. It does the
recipient of a gift no good to have his or her own rent paid for
month-in and month-out: you're only re-enforcing a pattern of behavior
that is unhealthy.

==== Give to Willing People in Bad Circumstances, not Unruly People

2 Thessalonians 3:9-12 gives the axiom that "Whoever will not work,
neither let him eat", as well as the command that "Those among you who
are idle and disruptive [...] should settle down and earn the food they
eat". Everyone goes through hard times, and it's a testament to the
truth of the Gospel that the Church takes care of its own, however we
are explicitly not commanded to support an idle lifestyle by giving to
those who will not work. If someone _can not_ work, that's a different
story, but for any able-bodied college student, you probably shouldn't
consider a financial gift to them if they're not employed, or at the
very least, aren't making a serious, concerted effort to become
employed.

==== Don't Encourage Dependence by Repeated Gifts

This principle is an extension of the above - If someone is continually
unable to pay their own way, then as busy as they may seems, they're
probably "Not actually busy, but living like busybodies" [2 Thess 3:11].
If someone isn't making enough money to set aside for unexpected
expenses, they need to re-consider their job situation and put
themselves on a budget until they can do so. To encourage otherwise by
repeated gifts is to encourage the bad attitudes towards money that were
discussed in the chapter on stewardship principles.

==== Give Gifts, not Loans

The Old Testament Law on Loans in Deuteronomy 25:19-20 and Exodus 22:25
states that those under the Law were not to charge any interest on their
loans. They were simply to lend, and then get re-payed the loan amount -
nothing more. To do otherwise was the commit usury - which is a term
now reserved for those who charge _unreasonable_ interest on loans. In
the New Testament this command is amplified by Romans 13:8 - to owe
nothing to one another except love. If you're in a position to make a
loan to another person, you're probably in a position to not expect the
money back. If you can't meet their needs all on your own, consider
taking up a collection from your local fellowship for them, spearheading
the effort yourself. You'll probably be able to give more, and the
person won't owe you anything in return. If someone insists on paying
you back, consider offering instead that they make the donation to your
church, or a well-run Christian aid fund, to magnify your gift.

==== Give in Secret, not in Public

Matthew 6:1 says that when you give, you should be wary of practicing
your righteousness before men, but instead not let your right hand know
what your left hand is doing. Those who give to men loan to God, and
Christ says that when you are acclaimed for your gifts, you already
receive your reward in full. Put off your reward until heaven when you
can get an everlasting reward.

You might be able to leave your gift for the person in a way they can
find it, or ask a trusted member of your fellowship to give it to the
other person, leaving you anonymous. At the very least, if you give it
to the recipient in person, ask them to speak of the gift in anonymous
terms - it's from "A Brother", not from Alex.

==== Find Ways to turn Gifts into a Testimony

We're not to practice our righteousness before men, but Matthew 5:16
says that we are to let our light shine before men, so they can glorify
our Father who is in heaven. Doesn't this contradict the previous
passage? It doesn't if you find ways of ensuring that God is the one who
gets the glory and credit for your gift. You might consider asking the
person (through a typed-out note if you've given it anonymously) to talk
about how God provided for their needs, and so give God the credit for
taking care of them through the body of Christ.

One of my favorite stories about God's provision (Which I'm glad to
tell) is when I needed an extra $75 to cover rent one month, and after
praying for God to provide I got a call from a caterer in our Church,
asking me if I'd like to make $75 that night catering a wedding! She had
no idea I was hard-up for cash, it was the sovereignty and goodness of
God that provided for me.

This is a biblical idea too. When Jesus cleansed the leper in Matthew
8:4, he told him to go and how himself to the priests, as a testimony to
them. Jesus was not only meeting a pressing need and validating his
authority over sickness to this one man, he also asked him to share his
story with others so that they too would believe.

==== (Potentially) Give for More than Just the Need Itself

In Matthew 5:40, Jesus says that if someone wants to sue you and take
your shirt, you are to give them your cloak as well. If we can act this
way to a hostile person who wants to take from us, how much more so can
we give abundantly to our own brothers and sisters who probably have not
even dared to ask from us! Therefore, it's an especially pleasing
testimony to the power of God that he's not only able to provide the
bare minimum for our needs, but also take care of a couple of extra
things as well.

==== Don't give with Stipulations or Conditions

Our secular culture slanders Christians as those who give to the needy
only if they convert to Christianity. Break the stereotype, and when you
give don't put additional stipulations on the gifts - for example, that
you'll help someone out with rent this month if they quit smoking. As
believers, we know that true change in our attitudes comes from a
regenerate heart and softness to God, not from someone else twisting our
wallets. We can suggest that someone change an unhealthy or
ownership-mentality, but those conversations should always be done in a
separate conversation from the gift itself. Our gifts should be given
freely, or else they're bribes.

If you want to help someone out with a specific need, for example buying
school books - you can go along with them to the store and pay for it
there. You'll ease some relational burdens while you're doing it,
and maybe also have the opportunity to treat them to a meal or a cup of
coffee in accordance with the principle above.

==== Give Precedence to Believers

Galatians 6:10 says that we are to do good to all men as we have
opportunity, especially believers. If you have to make the choice
between helping out a non-Christian friend and serving a brother,
scripture would seem to indicate that you serve the Christian. However,
the resources of the body of Christ are much more than your own, so
ideally you'll ask around and find some way to meet both.

You don't want to fall into the trap of the Pharisees, who "travel over
land and sea to make a single convert, and when he becomes one you make
him twice as much a son of hell as you are" [Matthew 25:13].
Over-zealousness for conversion is a slander to Christians - we should
instead invite our friends into a relationship with God where they can
have their most serious spiritual needs met. However, a simple
well-wishing isn't good either - James 2:16 makes it clear that our
faith has to be backed up by action. This might be an intractable
contradiction if you were working alone, but it's an opportunity for the
grace and power of God to flow from the body of Christ at large.

We're never likely to have to choose between a fellow believer's need
and a non-believer's need, but I do believe that this principle would
speak against regular giving to secular organizations, even well-meaning
and well-run charities. There's plenty of Christians doing good work as
well, and we should rather direct our giving to support those
organizations where God is glorified for the work that gets done when at
all possible.

=== Conclusion

I've explored here some principles of pressing-needs giving that are
found in scripture, but the bottom line is that we need to be giving
generously to meet pressing needs in any way we can. This is not only
commanded of us in scripture, it's also a testimony to the reality of
Christ's love for his people. By finding ways to give generously to meet
pressing needs among us, and keeping the principles above in mind, we
can continually give joyfully and wisely.
