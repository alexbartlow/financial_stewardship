== Crucial Attitudes

As Christians, we don't believe that we change outside-in, with
behaviors first. We believe that a regenerate heart and willingness to
follow God changes our attitudes, and from our attitudes, our behavior
flows naturally. Any discussion of change that does not talk about heart
attitudes in question will yield, at best, a short-lived change. If
you're reading this book, you're probably aware of how the financial
component of your life, or the life of someone around you needs change.
This is a good desire, but if you first don't change the heart attitudes
behind your current financial problems, you're unlikely to see change.
In this chapter, we will outline a number of attitudes that are crucial
to your success in changing this area of your life.

=== Stewardship vs. Ownership

The first attitude to understand is one of _stewardship_. Owners own
what they have and are fully responsible for using their resources.
Stewards, on the other hand, take care of goods on behalf of the real
owner. If someone lends you a car for a time, you don't own it, so it
would be totally inappropriate for you to sell it! However, since you're
a steward of the car, it would be expected of you not to crash it, or
maybe to give it a wash and change the oil.

As Christians, we believe Psalms 24:1 - the earth is the Lord's and
everything in it. If we don't own the world or anything in it, then it
is all on loan to us, and we need to regard it in that way. If we go
around spending our money or our time like it's our own, we are not
going to please God who lent our money and our time to us. (Hebrews 11:6
- Without Faith it is impossible to please God.)

Under an ownership mentality, everything we have can be put to use
meeting our own pleasures, lusts, and goals. If we're going to give
anything, we think about how much of our money we are going to give
away. Under a stewardship mentality, we should be asking ourselves "How
much of God's money are we going to keep to ourselves?" If we're going
to spend another on ourselves, we start thinking about how much of God's
money we're going to spend on ourselves.

This is a crucial and foundational attitude. Without viewing
your gifts, time, money, and relationships as a stewardship, you will
never be able to be financially stable, because you are ignoring the
reality of the world God has created. Later on in this book, you're
going to set up a budget, think about school and a job, and plan for the
future. If you go through those exercises but only think of the end goal
as having more money for yourself, you will never reach financial
stability. As you budget for the future, you will only find more and
more of your own lusts and pleasures to meet, and so your expenses will
balloon out of control. If you instead decide to get your finances in
order so that you can offer more of your money, time, and relationships,
to God, then God is behind you on your path to financial stability.
You'll find that you take less and less pleasure on spending your money
on yourself (Contentment), and more and more pleasure from serving others with your
money (Generosity). You'll be more open to input from others on how to
spend your time and money (Counsel) and you'll be more resistant to
Satan's plan to destroy your life through the accumulation of corrupting
wealth (The World's System).

Since this is a heart attitude, it only comes about through heart
change. Meditate on the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30), and pray that God will
give you this attitude depending on your past, this may take substantial
time to attain measurable victory in this area. However, God is the one
who is in you to will and to work to his good pleasure (Philippians
2:13), and no mater how long it takes, if you decide now that you want
to have his perspective on material things, he will give it to you.

=== Contentment

Christians have great reason to be content because God has said "I Will
Never leave you or forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5) Jesus says that a man's
life does not consist of his material possessions (Luke 12:15), and Paul
says that Godliness is a means of great gain if it is accompanied by
contentment (1 Timothy 6:6).

What does it mean to be rich? Is there a dollar amount that once you
have in the bank you are considered rich? If you think there is, you
should consider the fact that many families with incomes well into the
six-figures feel like they're only just barely scraping by every month.

I submit to you that being rich is having more money than you have
desire to spend it. If you have everything you need and want (but may
not everything you could possibly imagine) - your money is not going to
be the bottleneck to your happiness. You probably don't have the ability
to decide arbitrarily how much money you'll make, but you can change
your definitions of how much you need and how much you want. Ask
yourself: is having a sports car going to change my life in a
substantial way? I'll be able to drive faster, but unless I live
somewhere without speed limits I'll probably get where I'm going at the
same rate as everyone else. People might turn heads as I drive past, but
is their approval going to make me happier?

The fact is that your happiness will probably not increase beyond a
certain level of income - where you've met all your basic needs and you
still have a little left over for some special occasions every now and
then. (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html)
Secular studies put this number around $75,000 - but then again, people
in the world don't have the joy of the Lord! If you decide to take your
happiness from serving people and putting yourself in the center of
God's will, that number will probably sink lower.

Christians also have a basis for thankfulness. The greatest gift that we
have ever been given, and will ever be given, is our salvation through
Christ's blood, and our inheritance awaiting us in heaven. If you spend
part of each day meditating on the good things that God has given you,
that thankfulness will change your view of contentment. You can start to
ask yourself - "Will this thing I'm thinking about buying give me more
happiness than to know that I have eternal joy waiting for me in
heaven?" Of course, the answer is always no, because the answers to our
prayers are always yes in God.

If we're content with what we have, we won't want to spend money on
more. This is a simple fact, but it has profound repercussions. Take a
minute and look around at everything you've bought that's just sitting
around you, unused. I've got a bookshelf full of books I bought at
retail at $12 a pop, and now they're just expensive decorations. If I
didn't buy any of those books but borrowed them from friends or the
library, I'd have plenty more money lying around. The same goes for
video games, expensive meals out, and other luxury items. If we're
warm, fed, and have good friends around us and a purpose for our lives,
we can be content and thankful. Take some time and
build your thankfulness, and your desire for new things will evaporate.
