== Crucial Attitudes

As Christians, we don't believe that we change outside-in, with
behaviors first. We believe that a regenerate heart and willingness to
follow God changes our attitudes, and from our attitudes, our behavior
flows naturally. Any discussion of change that does not talk about heart
attitudes in question will yield, at best, a short-lived change. If
you're reading this book, you're probably aware of how the financial
component of your life, or the life of someone around you needs change.
This is a good desire, but if you first don't change the heart attitudes
behind your current financial problems, you're unlikely to see change.
In this chapter, we will outline a number of attitudes that are crucial
to your success in changing this area of your life.

=== Stewardship vs. Ownership

The first attitude to understand is one of _stewardship_. Owners own
what they have and are fully responsible for using their resources.
Stewards, on the other hand, take care of goods on behalf of the real
owner. If someone lends you a car for a time, you don't own it, so it
would be totally inappropriate for you to sell it! However, since you're
a steward of the car, it would be expected of you not to crash it, or
maybe to give it a wash and change the oil.

As Christians, we believe Psalms 24:1 - the earth is the Lord's and
everything in it. If we don't own the world or anything in it, then it
is all on loan to us, and we need to regard it in that way. If we go
around spending our money or our time like it's our own, we are not
going to please God who lent our money and our time to us. (Hebrews 11:6
- Without Faith it is impossible to please God.)

Under an ownership mentality, everything we have can be put to use
meeting our own pleasures, lusts, and goals. If we're going to give
anything, we think about how much of our money we are going to give
away. Under a stewardship mentality, we should be asking ourselves "How
much of God's money are we going to keep to ourselves?" If we're going
to spend another on ourselves, we start thinking about how much of God's
money we're going to spend on ourselves.

This is a crucial and foundational attitude. Without viewing
your gifts, time, money, and relationships as a stewardship, you will
never be able to be financially stable, because you are ignoring the
reality of the world God has created. Later on in this book, you're
going to set up a budget, think about school and a job, and plan for the
future. If you go through those exercises but only think of the end goal
as having more money for yourself, you will never reach financial
stability. As you budget for the future, you will only find more and
more of your own lusts and pleasures to meet, and so your expenses will
balloon out of control. If you instead decide to get your finances in
order so that you can offer more of your money, time, and relationships,
to God, then God is behind you on your path to financial stability.
You'll find that you take less and less pleasure on spending your money
on yourself (Contentment), and more and more pleasure from serving others with your
money (Generosity). You'll be more open to input from others on how to
spend your time and money (Counsel) and you'll be more resistant to
Satan's plan to destroy your life through the accumulation of corrupting
wealth (The World's System).

Since this is a heart attitude, it only comes about through heart
change. Meditate on the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30), and pray that God will
give you this attitude depending on your past, this may take substantial
time to attain measurable victory in this area. However, God is the one
who is in you to will and to work to his good pleasure (Philippians
2:13), and no mater how long it takes, if you decide now that you want
to have his perspective on material things, he will give it to you.

=== Contentment

Christians have great reason to be content because God has said "I Will
Never leave you or forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5) Jesus says that a man's
life does not consist of his material possessions (Luke 12:15), and Paul
says that Godliness is a means of great gain if it is accompanied by
contentment (1 Timothy 6:6).

What does it mean to be rich? Is there a dollar amount that once you
have in the bank you are considered rich? If you think there is, you
should consider the fact that many families with incomes well into the
six-figures feel like they're only just barely scraping by every month.

I submit to you that being rich is having more money than you have
desire to spend it. If you have everything you need and want (but may
not everything you could possibly imagine) - your money is not going to
be the bottleneck to your happiness. You probably don't have the ability
to decide arbitrarily how much money you'll make, but you can change
your definitions of how much you need and how much you want. Ask
yourself: is having a sports car going to change my life in a
substantial way? I'll be able to drive faster, but unless I live
somewhere without speed limits I'll probably get where I'm going at the
same rate as everyone else. People might turn heads as I drive past, but
is their approval going to make me happier?

The fact is that your happiness will probably not increase beyond a
certain level of income - where you've met all your basic needs and you
still have a little left over for some special occasions every now and
then. (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html)
Secular studies put this number around $75,000 - but then again, people
in the world don't have the joy of the Lord! If you decide to take your
happiness from serving people and putting yourself in the center of
God's will, that number will probably sink lower.

Christians also have a basis for thankfulness. The greatest gift that we
have ever been given, and will ever be given, is our salvation through
Christ's blood, and our inheritance awaiting us in heaven. If you spend
part of each day meditating on the good things that God has given you,
that thankfulness will change your view of contentment. You can start to
ask yourself - "Will this thing I'm thinking about buying give me more
happiness than to know that I have eternal joy waiting for me in
heaven?" Of course, the answer is always no, because the answers to our
prayers are always yes in God.

If we're content with what we have, we won't want to spend money on
more. This is a simple fact, but it has profound repercussions. Take a
minute and look around at everything you've bought that's just sitting
around you, unused. I've got a bookshelf full of books I bought at
retail at $12 a pop, and now they're just expensive decorations. If I
didn't buy any of those books but borrowed them from friends or the
library, I'd have plenty more money lying around. The same goes for
video games, expensive meals out, and other luxury items. If we're
warm, fed, and have good friends around us and a purpose for our lives,
we can be content and thankful. Take some time and
build your thankfulness, and your desire for new things will evaporate.

=== Generosity

We are called directly in scripture to "not set our hopes on the riches
of this age, [...but instead to...] be generous and willing to share,
storing up for yourselves treasures in heaven." (1 Timothy 6:17-18) If
we are stewards and do not own our money, and are content with what we
have, it follows that we will be looking for ways to give a blessing to
the world. Jesus himself gives this commandment - "Sell your possessions
and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear
out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes
near and no moth destroys." (Luke 12:33) The lesson here is clear - when
we give our money to people who need it, we are actually investing that
money in eternal rewards. This is one of the best investments you will
ever make - there is no risk (God is the one who guarantees your loan),
there is an immediate effect (The kingdom of God is advanced through
your efforts) and there is also an eternal return on your investment,
with riches that will never fade away. This teaching is all throughout
the bible, but stated succinctly in Proverbs 19:17 - "He who gives to
the poor lends to God." 

Another principle in scripture that should bear on our generosity is
that God rewards givers. Many health and wealth preachers have abused
these teachings to try to show that the path to riches is to give to
them, but these are no less true despite their twisting of the message.
"Whoever sows sparingly will reap sparingly, but whoever sows
plentifully will reap plentifully" (2 Corinthians 9:6) "One gives
freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give,
and only suffers want. Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one
who waters will himself be watered." (Proverbs 11:24-25) "Give, and it
will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together,
running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it
will be measured back to you." (Luke 6:38) However, we break with health
and wealth preachers when we maintain that what God will eventually give
us in response to our gifts is to be put to use also for God's Kingdom -
"Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a
little; I will set you over much." (Matthew 25:17) Jesus is talking here
about eternal work in which we will be faithful, but the principle is
sound - "To him whom much is given, much is expected" (Luke 12:48)

If you are faithful as a financial steward, you will probably make and
save more money over the course of your lifetime than someone who
squandered their riches on foolish things. This only makes sense - if
you're not constantly going into debt, running behind on your bills, and
saving for the future, you will be more stable and more well-off than
someone who is constantly in the grip of their bad habits. However, it
is never appropriate for Christians to decide they've given enough and
start treating themselves to what they deserve. You deserve hell, and
were saved from its fires by the blood of Christ! If you apply the
principles given earlier and take control of your financial state, God
will put you in a position where you can be faithful with much, and that
will be a gift of God that he has lavished on you. The important thing
is to develop the attitude of giving generously now while you have
little, so that attitude will hold when you are given much to steward.

=== Giving as Worship

=== Investing vs. Expense

This principle is not a scriptural one, but it is important nonetheless.
We will spend our money on many things - but only some of those things
will give us our money back. If something costs you money in the long
run, it is an expense. If money spent will return to you in the future,
it is an investment. Things like electronics, clothes, and food all
perish with use and will never give you a return - these are expenses.
They might be necessary to live, but they will still cause a net
negative to your balance statement. Other things like mutual funds and
stocks will (hopefully) increase in value over time, and thus will make
you money over the long term. Even if you're not in a position to start
buying mutual funds and stocks, it's still important to understand the
difference, because advertisers in the grip of the world's system will
try to convince you that some expenses are actually investments.

Have you ever heard something like a nice car be described as an
investment? That car will rust, break down, and lose value - therefore
it is an expense. It may lose its value more slowly than another, but it
just means it's not as much of an expense, not that it's magically
become an investment. Expenses lose value, investments gain value.

You may have taken on a large debt before picking up this book. In that
case, you need to understand that debt is an expense, no matter what.
You will be charged interest on your debt (Which is what makes your debt
an investment for the lender). Take a look at how much the interest
you're being charged is - for some credit cards, it might be as much as
25% APR. When considering a new investment, you should compare the
expected interest rate return on that investment with the interest rate
on the debt. You might make 10% APR on a mutual fund, but if you're
carrying a balance on your credit card of 25%, you're losing money by
not paying down your debt. That's why the first course of action when
you have extra money is usually to pay down your debts. Not all debt is
bad debt though - you might be paying off a car at a 5% interest rate.
In that case, the 10% interest on the mutual fund will be worth more in
the long run. As I said before, this may not be applicable to you now, but
it will be later. Internalize this principal now while you're still a
student, and you'll be able to make sound financial choices later.

=== The World's System

=== Your Accounts

This is a book about financial stewardship, so we're going to be talking
mostly about money. However, you are a steward of everything God has
given you, so you should be evaluating everything God has entrusted to
you.

Beyond money, you also have your time - and you can spend your time
working for money, but also for doing work for the Kingdom of God. It
would be foolish of you to spend all of your time working and not doing
anything for the Kingdom of God, so there needs to be wise decisions
made here about how much you can work. Likewise, you also have your
emotional and physical state to steward - if you're spending money on
cigarettes, you're destroying your body while you deplete your bank
account. If you're working long hours of manual labor you're also doing
damage to your body which will catch up with you in the long run. If
you're working at a job that you hate, you're spending emotional energy
working, so you're going to have less emotional energy to give to your
family and friends.

The point of financial stewardship is not only to increase your
financial accounts, it's also to increase the amount you can give in
other areas of your life. If you get stuck in a dead-end job now, you're
going to have to work long hours when you hope to have a family, which
will decrease how much you can give to them with your presence. By the
same token, if you commit yourself to a high-powered career job that
makes a lot of money but also reduces your emotional stockpile, you'll
have that much less to give. Think about how to ensure that working and
managing your money takes up a smaller and smaller portion of your time
and energy, so you have more energy to give to the people around you,
and through that, God's purpose. If you can get away with working 5
hours a week and volunteering your time to God for the rest of it, do
it! God will return your investment in that time as well. For most of
us, the goal will be to reduce our time budgeting and making money
to 40 hours a week if we're working full time, or about 15-20 hours a
week if we're still in school. This will ensure that you make enough to
live on, give from, and save, without selling all of your other accounts
to the world's system. If money is a constant stress for you, reducing
the stress and worry through a budgeting system is a good investment -
since it pays for itself in other areas. Likewise, paying someone to do
work for you on your house or car may free up large amounts of time to
spend on other things. The important thing is to have a holistic
perspective, where you try to maximize all of your accounts, so you can
give freely in every area of your life.
