== School

Since this is a financial stewardship book for students, I hope this
section will be relevant to you. If you're working full time right now,
I hope that you're planning on going back to school at some point.
Contrary to what you were told in High School by guidance counselors and
motivational speakers, a four-year school is not always the best place
to get an education. In fact, until relatively recently, nearly everyone got
vocational training through apprenticeship. We'll talk about some of
these alternative options later.

It's important to be discerning about college. For pre-college students,
the entire weight of the world's system has been pushing you toward a
four-year program your entire life. Chances are even if you have
Christian parents who love the Lord, they're still pushing you toward a
college. They're being well intentioned of course - the right college
degree can launch you into a career where you can give generously to
the Lord's work, and give you an opportunity to do work you enjoy. I
went to college and I hated it, but now I'm in a career (Software
Development) that I really like, and it would have been much harder to
get my foot into the door of that field without a four-year degree.
However, as I do more woodworking and metalworking as hobby, I've often
wondered if I'd have been just as happy as a master carpenter. I've even
toyed with the idea of trying my hand at furniture-building after my
current contract expires. However, these are options that are available
to me only because I went to school, got a well-paying job, and have
some financial stability. A good table-saw (The primary thing you need
to do any sort of real wood-working) costs $500-$600 used, and I can't
imagine trying to save up for that while still working a job at $12 an
hour.

This chapter pre-supposes that universities are effectively a large
certification machine that equips students with entry-level credentials
to join their respective fields. Like it or not, that's what most
colleges and universities have become. Colleges have become steeped in
the ideas of philosophical materialism (that there are only material
things in the world), and so they cannot become an accurate guide to
anything else but the accumulation of power through money. Colleges can
broaden your horizons by exposing you to different world-views, but if
you become an avid reader you'll be exposed to those anyway. The only
real reason to go to college in our culture is to set yourself up for a
post-graduation job. If this sounds a bit mercenary and of low purpose,
that's because it is exactly that.

As Christians, we have a calling to speak the redeeming love of God into
a lost generation and be light and salt for the world. Colleges exist to
make money by equipping people to make money. Your eternity will out-last
the most prestigious college by innumerable millennia. In light of these
truths, we reject the notion that we find a higher meaning or higher
calling through higher education. However, as discussed in the chapter
on principles, money is a useful tool of dual-value, that can aid in our
efforts to bring God's love to a lost generation. As such, the next
section will attempt to dissuade you from getting a degree that is not
an appropriate investment in the future of the financial aspect of your
God-given mission.

=== Choosing a School

Your choice of major may only be offered at a private or state school,
but you might be able to transfer credits from a community college.
Columbus State has all of their transfer programs synced up really well
to OSU, and their classes cost a fraction of the price. If you can, it's
almost always worth it to go through the hassle of transferring credits
over to a state or private school. Once they've transferred, they're
exactly the same as the ones the school itself offers, they just cost
you a lot less.

What's more, your grades won't transfer over from the community college.
If you're like most students, you'll probably tank your first semester
or two as you get used to studying and college life, so there's no
reason to have that dragging down your GPA. Introductory level calculus
classes are notoriously brutal as well. Nearly everyone I talk to
who went to a state school for all four years regrets it, for both cost
and grade reasons. You'll have to talk to academic advisors at both
schools about your plan of transferring, but they'll be able to help you
pretty effectively, especially if they have a symbiotic relationship
like Columbus State and OSU have.

I actually feel so strongly about this that I think the burden of proof
is on _not_ going two years at a community college and then
transferring. If your parents are disagreeable, you should be able to
simply present the price-tag and that will persuade most of them. If
they still offer resistance, assure them that your degree will still be
from the private or state school, and won't have an asterisk on it
indicating a transfer. A degree is a degree. The prestige isn't affected
in the slightest, but that's a world system value anyway.

Going to a community college your first couple years also means that you
stay out of the dorms, which is a huge expense, and often spiritually
damaging for immature Christians. Without the accountability of living
with a Christian bother or sister, it's that much easier to get into sin
living in the dorms. By not living there and paying into a meal plan,
you can follow the advice in the food section, save a ton of money, and
probably move into a Christian rooming or ministry house where you'll
have accountability and spiritual guidance from older believers. See
http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/minhse.htm[This Paper]
footnote:[http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/minhse.htm] for some of
the benefits of ministry house life, as well as the commitments you'll
be making by forming that sort of community.

Community Colleges are also great if you think you want to go to school,
but don't know exactly what you'll want to do. The average student
changes their major twice while in school - I changed mine 4 times!
That's a lot of wasted time and money that you're paying for - so by
getting your GEC classes out of the way and giving yourself some time to
think, you're saving yourself a lot of money in the process.

=== Vocational Programs

I said earlier that a four-year college is not for everyone. STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) fields are in great demand in
the marketplace, and generally require a four year degree, but liberal
arts programs, while exposing you to a lot of great literature and
interesting knowledge, generally prepare you pretty poorly for a career.
The clich√© about the English PHD working as a Starbucks Barista exists
because those fields just don't have the demand that the STEM field
does. In Software Development, pretty much every graduate gets a job in
their field right after graduation.

If you're interested in being a writer or otherwise pursuing a liberal
arts degree, take some time and consider a vocational program that you
can pursue before or during your degree. You'll be establishing a
back-up plan doing an honorable profession if your dream job doesn't
come along, do some honest work, get paid well, and be able to pay for
your liberal arts degree out of pocket instead of with student loans.

Here are some entry-level vocational jobs and their respective salaries. footnote:[http://salary.com 2012]

.Average Entry-Level Salaries for Vocational Jobs
|=============
|Plumber|$40,608
|Electrician|$43,470
|HVAC|$40,709
|Auto Mechanic|$34,016
|Carpenter|$39,088
|Dental Hygienist|$62,174
|Medical Lab Technician|$42,690

Compare the salaries above to entry level salaries for a variety of
degrees. footnote:[www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2007/winter/art01.pdf]

.Average Entry-Level Salaries for Liberal Arts Degrees
|============
|History| $35,092
|Foreign Language| $35,057
|English| $31,924
|Psychology| $31,857
|====

These are all entry-level jobs, many with paid apprenticeship options
where you can make $15,000 or so while still learning your trade. A
quick glance at the numbers shows that these are viable options -
especially since you won't have to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt
while you get your degree, a cost not shown in the above chart on
liberal-arts degrees. If you're currently working a dead-end
fast-food or service job waiting to get back into school, consider
picking up vocational trade-training now, and going back to school after
a few years in your field. You'll be financially stable enough to
provide for a family, debt-free, and have a solid fall-back plan if your
degree doesn't work out.

=== Books and School Expenses

The price of tuition is only the starting cost of getting an education.
You'll also have to plan for books and other expenses that go along
with tuition.

Textbooks are usually $65 a pop, and you'll need at least one for every
class. You might also have lab kits that run $75 or so each, as well as
other paperback books for your liberal arts courses, which are cheaper
but more numerous. In general, If you plan on paying sticker price, it's
a good plan to budget an additional $100/class/semester for books,
paper, pens, and other expenses. 

Of course, you don't have to pay sticker price. Here's a few tricks that
can help you save some money on this relatively massive expense:

==== Don't buy the textbook.

Sometimes this is a viable option. You'll almost always need to buy
textbooks for Math classes since those have homework problems in them,
and if you have a bad instructor you'll end up teaching yourself from
the book anyway, but you might be able to get away with it for other
courses. If you'll only need the textbook once or twice a semester (from
looking at the syllabus) you can check your school's library to see if
they have reference copies that you can use at the library, but not
check out. Spending a couple of hours at the library can save you $100
on a textbook. I think it's worth $50 an hour to do these assignments in
the library.

For classes where the instructor provides notes online, you'll probably
be able to just use the notes. This includes the lion's share of GEC and
introductory
courses where instructors use a standard set of notes each quarter and
rarely change them.

When in doubt, try to go a week or so to see if you really need the
textbook. Worst case, you'll just have to to go the bookstore.

==== Buy old editions

Again, this won't work for math courses where the problems change each
edition, but it might for other classes. If you get an old edition
you'll have to deal with different page numberings, but generally
everything else is the same.

You won't be able to find old editions at the bookstore, but you can
online, often times for under $10, which brings me to:

==== Check online

http://half.com, http://alibris.com and http://amazon.com can all be
good ways of saving money on textbooks. It'll take a little longer for
them to get in, so you might have to buddy up with a classmate who
bought the book (sucker!) for the first week or so, but in general it
pays off.

Always check online, especially for old editions. One teacher actually
assigned an old edition intentionally and told us point-blank to get it
online where it would be much cheaper than bookstore. The book stores
were selling them for $127 and buying them back for $60, but I found the
book online for $10. I actually bought every copy I could find online
and sold them all back to different bookstores for extra cash.

==== Split the cost with Roommates

If you're in a house with a lot of people who are starting school at the
same time, try to get into the same section with them. Not only will you
be able to team-up on evangelistic study parties, you'll only need to
buy one copy of the text-book.


=== Student Loans & FAFSA

Students Loans are practically limitless depending on your economic
status through FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). This
can be a good thing as it enables you to get through your degree without
paying for it out of pocket, but a side-effect of nearly limitless money
for students coming into college means that tuition prices have soared
as a result of supply-and-demand. Americans currently have more Student
Loan debt than credit card debt. What's more, Student Loan Debt is one
of the few types of debt that won't be discharged in the event of
bankruptcy - you'll have those loans hanging over your head until you
pay them off.

Federal Student loans generally come with nominal interest rates and the
interest you'll pay on them can be deferred (subsidized) until you
graduate or stop going to school - so you won't have to pay anything
while you're in school. However, once you're out of school, as a rough
rule of thumb, you'll have to pay about $125 a month for every $10,000
in Federal loans you've taken on during college, for the next 10 or 20
years. There are income-based repayment plans that scale the size of
your payment to your income, but if you're going to have trouble paying
off the loan, you might want to reconsider your plans for school in the
first place. Loans are spending money that you don't have, which is very
dangerous in the first place, even more so if you don't know if you'll
have a job waiting for you when you graduate.

Personally, I'm a fan of the proper use of student loans. Federal loans
helped get me through school, and now that I have a well-paying career I
don't have a problem paying the bill (of course if I had finished my
English Degree like I intended when I started, the situation would be a
whole lot different!). However, you need to be aware of the risks to
make an informed decision.

Federal loans can be a great investment - in the sense that by incurring
the expense now you'll set yourself up for a well-paying career later
on. However, if your chosen field of study doesn't tend to perform well
in the marketplace, you could be signing yourself up for a lifetime of
financial hardship. If you think paying the bills is hard now, think
about when you also have a family to take care of! Make sure that you
have a realistic plan in place for paying off the debt that you take on
while in school.

Private loans a different story. Banks offer private loans for students,
but they're almost always a bad decision. For one, the interest is never
subsidized, so the amount you take on will start getting bigger the day
after you sign the papers. In addition, the interest rate is also a lot
higher than Federal loans. If you're in a situation where you're
thinking about taking on private loans, you'd probably be better served
going for a vocational program and saving up for your degree that way.

Student loans should really only be used for educational expenses like
books, tuition, and maybe some limited help every now and then for rent.
If you get into the habit of using excess loan money to pay for fast
food runs and cigarettes, you're re-enforcing a terrible pattern of
spending money you don't have. Remember, "He who does not work, neither
let him eat." We're called to carry our own laden - and that means
working for all of your spending money. Even worse would be the habit of
spending money just because it's there - which is a terrible ownership
mentality instead of a stewardship mentality. Excess student loan
disbursements should be the easiest money to have a steward's attitude
towards, since you did absolutely no work for it!

=== Scholarships

Many scholarships are available to people going to school - some you can
apply for while in high school based on your GPA and standardized test
scores. When people talk about getting a full or half-ride scholarship,
these are what they're talking about. When you apply for scholarships
with a school itself, they'll generally give you some money so they can
stitch you up for the cost of dorms and tuition later. If you've gotten
one of these scholarships, you have to work hard to ensure your GPA
stays above the levels outlined in the scholarship, otherwise the school
_will_ revoke your scholarship. This is really rough since your first
year at school is usually the hardest with meat-grinder introductory
courses.

If you're already in college, the ship has probably sailed on getting a
piece of that action. However, you can still, at any time, apply for
scholarships from other places. Companies give out scholarships as a
tax-break, as a community service, and also as a recruitment tool. In
addition, other non-profit groups give out scholarships as well.
Resources like http://collegescholarships.org collect lists of these
scholarships, and a simple search online will turn up many more lists of
scholarships sortable by state, subject of study, and eligibility
requirements.

You'll have to do some digging and some grunt-work to find and apply for
scholarships. However, even if you spend 10 hours for every $1000
scholarship you land, you're still making $100 an hour! Make sure you
exhaust your resources looking for scholarships before you tap into
financial aid - since scholarships are free money. It can be frustrating
applying to these and never hearing back - but all you need is one
scholarship to come through for the time to have been worth it.
