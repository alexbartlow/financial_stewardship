=== Cash

Keeping your disposable income in cash means you won't
track it online with some of the accounting software we'll look at
later, but you will be able to see how much you have
left to spend each week by just looking at your wallet. If you've
already decided on an allowance for yourself, take it out in cash at the
ATM each week.

You'll only want to get cash at an ATM for your bank - don't throw
money away by using another bank's ATM. You'll get hit with fees by both
the bank you used, and your own bank for a 'foreign withdrawal charge'.
This can be as much as $5/withdrawal, so if you take out money 4 times a
month you're throwing away $20/month for no reason! If you have a Chase
debit card, only take out money at a Chase ATM.

Many people will 'cash in' their entire paycheck, and carry it around in
their wallet. This is a terrible idea! For one, if you lose your wallet,
you're really hurting! Also, carrying around cash like this means that
you'll lose sight of things like rent or giving. I don't think it's ever
a good idea of pay for things more than $40 in cash - just write a check
for rent from your checking account. Train yourself to view cash in your
wallet as something you're free to spend, and don't ever put more cash
in your wallet than you're willing to spend or able to spend.

=== Credit Card

A credit card is given out by a credit card company like Capital One, or
by most banks, and they make an account for
you in their system. Instead of being like a checking account where the
balance goes down every time you use it, your balance in a credit
account goes up every time you use it - and then at the end of the month
they send you a bill for the total amount. You'll also have a 'credit
limit' - the maximum amount of money that they're willing to lend you.
For a starter credit card, this will usually be something like $500.

Of course, they wouldn't make any money if they just fronted you some
cash and then you paid them back. So Credit Card Companies offer what's
called a 'minimum payment' - typically something like $15, that you are
required to pay (or they hit you with a fee, more money for them) If you
leave any balance on the card, they'll add on *interest* to the amount
you owe them, and send you a bill next month for the original amount,
plus interest! Most credit cards have an interest rate between 15% and
30%, which means if you spent $115 last month on your credit card and
paid the minimum balance, next month they'll send you a bill for $130.
You just threw away $30!

Credit cards only really benefit you in few ways. First, they give you
access to money you do not have. This is really dangerous! Spending
money you don't have is stupid. The only time you should ever spend
money you don't have is when the consequences for not doing it are so
severe you're better off paying the interest rate - for example, when
your car gets towed, your bank account is at $0, and the towing company
is going to charge you $20 a day until you pay $100 for the towing fee.
Get your car out quickly, and then pay off the credit card company as
soon as you can.

The main reason people get credit cards is to 'build credit.' 'Credit'
in this sense is how likely you are to pay back someone who lends you
money. If you take out a loan on a house or car, the lender will look at
your credit (in the form of a credit score) to see if you are likely to
pay back what you owe. If you have bad credit, you'll pay a lot more in
interest. Paying your bills on time, and keeping your credit balance
less than 30% of your credit limit will build credit. If you go over
this amount, or miss a bill payment, you'll lose credit very quickly.
Building credit is important, but not as important as making sure you're
financially stable. If you miss a payment on your credit card, be sure
to get it paid off, and then consider not using it again for a while.
When you're working your first career job, you'll have plenty of time to
build credit before you need to buy a house. Now, when you're scraping
by each month and doing some of the most important work of your spiritual
life, is not the time to buy into the world system's lie of
planning out your future.

If you can't commit to paying off your credit card, in full, every
month, don't get a credit card. If you do get a credit card, consider
only using it for one thing each month - for example, the grocery store
or buying gas. Never use a credit card when you can't pay it off at the
end of the month, or you'll find yourself throwing more and more money
away as interest.

When you hear about people getting into a bunch of debt, it's because
they ran up the balance on their credit cards. Credit cards are
something to be afraid of - they can ruin your finances for years just
because of a single careless purchase you couldn't afford. There's
nothing worth buying now that will make up for the stress you'll bring
into your marriage with a bunch of consumer debt.

=== Debit Card

A debit card is like a credit card, but instead of running up a balance,
it deducts from your checking account for each purchase. This gives you
all the convenience of a credit card, but none of the expense. Your bank
will generally give you a debit card for free, but you might have to go
into the branch and request one.

The down-side to this convenience is that you're always carrying around
your checking account with you, and you can spend a lot of money with a
simple swipe. If you're going to carry a debit card, it would be a good idea to set up
some rules for yourself on when you're going to allow yourself to use
it. In general, only use your debit card on expenses that you've planned
for, like gas and food at the grocery store. You can pay for everything
else with cash. If you use your debit card for everything, you'll risk
over-spending and losing a grip on your allowance.

I'm a lot less cautious about debit cards as I am about credit cards,
but you should still have some sense of caution about the power of
transferring large amounts of money with a swipe.

=== Checking Account

A checking account is an account with a bank that will hold your money.
You can usually get a free checking account through most banks - they
want you to think of them first when you're buying a home or a car later
on.

Unlike credit cards or debit cards, everyone should have a checking
account. It's a safe place to store your money, and you can go in and
access it at any time. You can even sign up for direct deposit at most
jobs, so that your paycheck is automatically sent to your checking
account! Likewise, giving is a lot easier when you sign up for EFT
(Electronic Funds Transfer) - which automatically deducts how much you
want to give from your checking account every month. I don't even think
about my giving when it happens anyone - I just look at my bank account
a couple days later and see that my gift has already gone out. Having a
checking account with direct deposit and EFT is the easiest way to make
sure you come through on your pledge.

One caveat for checking accounts is 'over-drafting.' This is when you
try to write a check or use your debit card for an amount more than what
is in your checking account. What happens then can vary, but usually
your bank will allow the transaction to go through, and then charge you
a $30 or so fee. Once in college, I had forgotten my balance and
overdrafted buying books for school, then bought a couple cups of coffee
that day saw a movie that night. When I checked my bank account that
night, I was $120 in the red! Unless you like throwing away money, make
sure you never overdraft. You can usually set up alerts via text or
email with your bank to let you know if you balance is below a certain
amount, or you can go into your bank's branch and have them set your
account to deny any transaction that would cause you to over-draft. This
means your card will be declined if there's insufficient funds, but it's
better than buying a $30 cup of coffee.

It's a good idea to store about two months worth of expenses in your
checking account. Checking accounts don't give you interest, which means
the bank is not paying you for keeping your money with them. To get a
small amount of interest (and avoid hassle if your debit card gets
stolen), consider moving extra money beyond this two month cushion to
your Savings Account.

=== Savings Account

A savings account is a long-term storage account for your money. It
still doesn't give you a whole lot of interest, but at least you'll get
some. You're not supposed to withdraw money from your savings account
(You'll actually get a fee if you make too many withdrawals in a month),
but you can make a deposit to your savings account as much as you like.

A savings account is great for holding a bigger cushion of money - maybe
6 months worth of expenses. If your baseline budget comes out to $600 a
month, make it a goal to save up to $3,600 in your savings. You can use
this for things like paying for a quarter of school, expensive books, a
car, or for an eternal investment - giving gifts like scholarships to
student mission trips.

A savings account shouldn't be something you think about too often. Put
money in when you can, and forget about it. Once you're in your first
career job, you can start thinking about better ways to put your money
to work, but for right now, a savings account works just fine.
