== Budgeting

In this chapter, you're going to learn how to make a simple budget, and
then figure out an allowance for yourself.

=== Why Budget?

Having a budget is one of the best ways to ensure that you meet your
financial goals. Even if your financial goals are making rent at the end
of the month, you still need to plan out your expenditures. It does you
no good to burn through your pay-check one week, and then have to
tighten the belt the next. As discussed in the chapter on stewardship,
this approach to money re-enforces negative patterns. To counter-act
this, setting up a constant rate at which you'll spend your money allows
you to plan, have a sane view of your money, and ensure you don't have
to scramble for rent or unforeseen expenses. A budget allows you to have
your financial life function well without too much work, so you can set
your mind on other, more important things.

It's easy to over-plan your budget. Structuring your spending too
tightly means more stress for too little return. Think of your time
spend budgeting and looking at your budget as an investment, like work.
The only difference is, instead of getting more money for each hour your
budget, you get less and less per hour the more time you spend doing it.
It's best to find a budget that works for you and stick too it, without
micro-managing all the particulars.

The approach I like to use is to start with the most important items in
your budget, and work your way to the smaller ones. Imagine you have to
fill a bucket full of big rocks, small rocks, and sand. The bucket is
your budget. The big rocks
are your most important expenses, like giving and rent. The small rocks
are less important things like gas and food. The sand is your least
important expenses, like books, coffee, cigarettes, and fast food. If
you fill the bucket with sand, you won't have any space left for the big
rocks. If you put your big rocks in first, then your small rocks, you'll
still have some space left over for the small things.

=== Setting up your Budget

The most important things to put into your budget are giving and rent.
Giving, as discussed in the first-things-first chapter, is one of the
most important things you can do for your financial and spiritual
future. Even if you're only giving a dollar or five a month, you're
still making an investment in your future as a steward and in your
eternity. Decide right now a range of how much you want to give first,
before anything else. Find a number you think is generous, but do-able.
Then think about adding a little more to that.

Rent is next. You should know how much this is month-to-month by talking
with your land-lord. If this number fluctuates because of utilities,
figure out an average amount, and if the amount you actually pay in a
given month is less than that, save the left-overs. You can use it
later without stressing about money. Keep a running tally of how much
you've put aside for future rent. Tools like http://mint.com allow you
to set budgets that roll-over every month, to keep this easy.

If you are the land-lord, your utility companies can put you on an
average payment plan, so you pay the same amount every month, if that's
easier for you.

After rent, you're going to budget for food, gas, short-term savings, and any other fixed
expenditures, like loans you have to re-pay or a gym membership. See the chapter on food for
tips on figuring out a meal plan and a food budget. Add that number to
your budget. For gas for your car, take the average of what you've paid
the last three months. For other fixed expenses, add these to your
budget. Short-term savings is used for trips, retreats, presents, and
other things like that you won't have to pay every month, but will come
up intermittently. Figure out what you'll spend on these each year, and
divide it by twelve. This is your monthly budget for short-term savings.

Adding it up, we'll get something like this:

.My Budget
| Giving | 30|
| Rent| 250|
| Gas | 30 |
| Food | 100 |
| Fixed Expenses| |
| - Car Payment | 150 |
| - Re-Pay Dad | 25 |
| Short-Term Savings | 20 |
| Total | 605 |

This is what we'll call your *Baseline Budget* this is how much money
you'll need to make every month to stay afloat. If your current income
doesn't match up to this, adjust some numbers until it does, or think
about getting a new job. See our chapter on jobs for some ideas. You might have some
extra each month that you haven't budgeted for. We'll call that your
*Disposable Income*. 

You may wonder why I didn't budget for other things like beer, soda,
cigarettes, movies, or fast food. The reason is that you should think
about budgeted things as hard-and-fast needs, and these other things as
money that you're literally disposing of - throwing away. Every time you
light a cigarette, you're burning money. Every time you buy a Big Mac
Meal,
you're trading a home-cooked meal for an unhealthy one and a five dollar
bill. You should think about all this money you're burning as a series
of trade-offs. Do I want to buy a soda now, or a coffee before work
tomorrow? Do I want to go to that movie tonight, or get a burger with
some co-workers after work? If you think of these things as budgeted,
you're going to want to spend your whole budget. If you think of these
things as trade-offs, you'll think more carefully about
everything you buy, because you're giving up something else you want.

=== Budget Methods

A pen and some paper are all you really need to make a budget, but
keeping up on your budget might get a little complicated. You could
print off a little card with running totals to keep in your wallet, but
you're likely to miss a couple of transactions and go off your budget.
http://mint.com offers you a way to categorize your transactions
automatically, as long as you're using a debit card for most of your
transactions. See the chapter on Financial Tools to learn how best to
use your debit card, as well as Mint.com. You could also carry a check-book, and write checks, but this
inconvenient, and you're also just as likely to go off your budget when
you miss recording a payment. You can keep a spreadsheet on your
computer, but then you'll have to remember everything you buy and record
it later, which is hard to do than just keeping a card in your wallet!

Whatever you choose, make sure you stick with it. See the Financial
Tools chapter for ideas on how you an integrate some of these into your
life. Whatever you choose, checking your balance every day is a sure
recipe for stressing out about money, which means you'll have less
emotional energy left for other things, like relationships. Try to get
into the habit of checking up on your balance every week. This is often
enough that you can adjust your spending if it looks like you're getting
into trouble, but not often enough to start stressing out over it.

=== Allowances and Affordances

Now we have a budget, and you've picked a couple tools for managing
your spending. Now we have to figure out what to do with your Disposable
Income as discussed earlier. We're going to talk about two ways of
looking at your disposable income: *Allowances* and *Affordances*

Allowance means the amount of money you're *allowing* yourself to spend. If you had an allowance growing up, this was the
amount of your parent's money you were allowed to spend each week. I
never had one growing up, and idea of putting myself on an allowance as
a college student seemed silly, but it can be very effective. Whenever
you buy something out of your allowance, your new allowance becomes
whatever it was before, minus how much you just spent. This re-enforces
the trade-off mentality that we talked about earlier.

Affordance means how much money you can *afford* to spend each month. I
can afford to buy a pack of gum, a new book, and a new video game, but
just because I can afford something doesn't mean it's a good idea. In
fact, if you're about to buy something, and your first thought is to
re-assure yourself that you can afford it, it's probably not a good
purchase! When you think about what you can afford, you're thinking
about your total buying power (How much disposable income you have), and
then comparing that to the cost of what you're buying. The problem with
this idea is that you'll probably not stop to adjust your idea of what
you can afford each month. I can afford a $50 purchase, but I can't
afford 4 $50 purchases this month.

This is why allowances are so helpful - if you keep it as a piece of
paper wrapped around your debit card with this month's total on it,
or cash in your wallet, every time you reach into your allowance, you're
reminded that you're taking money away from your allowance. This will
help you reign in your spending. In general, I think allowances should
be kept in cash. If you keep your allowance in the back of your head or
written down somewhere and use your debit card, it's too easy to forget.
If you want to know if you've allowed yourself enough money to buy a cup
of coffee, just look into your wallet for a couple bucks. Once you've
decided your allowance for each month, break it down into weeks so
you're not resenting yourself at the end of each month. Take out that
much cash a week, and use it for all your small purchases.

=== Savings

Your allowance shouldn't be everything you have left-over after your
baseline budget. Pick a sensible amount, and stick with it. The rest of
your disposable income, you're going to save.

Saving is crucial to your financial future. When your car breaks down or
you need a new bike, or something else happens that you didn't budget
for, if you don't have any savings, you're really going to be hurting.
The best way to plan for things like this is not to make a budget for
it, but just to save money for the future when you'll need it. I like to
save two months of my expenses into my checking account, and then
everything else goes into my 'savings' account. If something happens
that I can cover with my checking account, I will. Otherwise, I'll move
some money over from my savings account. If it looks like I've got more
cushion than I need in my checking account (my short-term storage), I'll
move money over into my savings account.


If at the end of the month you still have cash in my wallet you haven't
spent, it's a good idea to skip a week of your allowance, and then move
that money into savings instead. Building up a cushion like this gives
you some room for things like getting towed. Being 'broke' is no fun,
and distracts you from being able to be a giver, both financially and
relationally with other people. If you have a cushion of savings, you're
able to deal with what comes your way, and not be a burden on anyone
else.

On the flip side, if you ever get money you didn't expect, from a gift
or an odd job, throw it directly into savings. Don't run out and buy
something right away! After you've thought about it for a little bit,
you can spend that money, once you're sure you won't compromise yourself
financially do it. There's little rush to save a ton of money; but
getting into the habit of saving is much, much easier than breaking the
habit of impulsive spending. If you are disciplined about saving
everything you can, you'll have plenty for the big ticket items that are
really worth it.

=== Conclusion

Between your baseline budget, your disposable income, and your savings,
this should take up all of the money you're going to make this month. Be
sure to re-visit your budget every three months or so to ensure it's
really realistic. If it turns out you're not spending your entire gas
budget on gas, consider decreasing your gas budget and increasing your
giving or savings. 

Remember, the goals of a budget are to make sure you're meeting all of
your expenses, and to get yourself peace of mind about your finances, so
you're not worrying about it all the time. When you discipline yourself
to stick to a budget you're developing responsibility, and when you
start viewing your disposable income as series of trade-offs, you're
exercising stewardship. I'm really glad I took the time to learn this in
college; now, as I'm in my career, the money I make doesn't stress me
out as much as it did before. Scripture says that "he who is faithful
with little will be faithful with much," so if you want to be faithful
for the rest of your life while you work in a career, you'd better get
your financial life in order now!
